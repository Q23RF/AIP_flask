# AI POET
made for an expo

## FEATURES

### MAIN
writes poems with given parameters, prints selected ones (just to console now cuz i don't have a machine).

### FEEDBACK
doesn't really send feedbacks it's just a cool lil box where u can type whatever u want and i won't know ab them.

### GALLERY
shows some of the AI poet's previous work.

## TO-DOs

### ~~actual printing feature~~   DONE!
gotta post selected poems to another website so that they can apply to some design made there and eventually get printed out.

### optimizing
the poet writes stuffs that are grammarly wrong. i coded LINES to stop that but they just wont work.

### MORE training data
it's kinda dumb now.
